# Instagram Clone

An Instagram-like web application that mimics key features of the popular social media platform, including image double-tap like, heart single-tap like, story viewing experience, and user profile opening with seamless transitions. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

### 1.Image Double-Tap Like
   -Description: Users can double-tap on an image to instantly "like" it. A heart animation appears to indicate the action.
   -Implementation: This feature is implemented using JavaScript to listen for double-tap events on images and CSS for the heart animation.

### 2.Heart Single-Tap Like
   -Description: Users can single-tap on the heart icon below an image to like or unlike the post. The heart icon fills with color when liked and returns to its original state when unliked.
   -Implementation: JavaScript is used to toggle the heart icon’s state, while CSS handles the visual transition.

### 3.Story Viewing Experience
   -Description:Users can view stories with a UI similar to Instagram, including automatic story progression and manual navigation (e.g., tap to go forward/backward, swipe to skip).
   - **Implementation:** JavaScript controls the story timers and navigation, with CSS used to style the story elements and transitions.

### 4.User Profile Opening Experience
   -Description: Users can click on a profile image or username to seamlessly transition to a detailed profile view, showing user posts, follower counts, and more.
   -Implementation: CSS transitions are used for the smooth opening effect, while JavaScript dynamically loads the user’s profile data.
